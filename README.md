<div align="center"><h1>Web Dev Starter Guide / Advice:</h1></div>

<h3>Web Development is a really fun subfield to know about, but at the same time, it's an ever-growing subfield, so understanding the pipeline to learn it can be a bit confusing. Since it can get so confusing, I just wanted to share the path that I personally took to learn and understand it better.</h3>

## First Steps (Bare HTML/CSS/JS):

My personal first step into web development was a state of confusion for myself about where I should start and what I should build. After going down several rabbit holes that seemed too complex for me, I came across a portfolio site template on replit: [Portfolio Website Template](https://replit.com/@AshishJob/Portfolio-Website-Template) which was built on bare HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, of which I knew none. BUT I just messed around with different HTML tags and CSS definitions and looked into [HTML documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) to understand what changes I could make. In case you aren't familiar with each technology, HTML is HyperText Markup Language which is a tool to mark the content and structure of pages, CSS is Cascading Style Sheets which is a tool to style each page with colors and features, and JavaScript is a programming language that works for the functions under the cover and very generally used in web development.

### TLDR:
- [Replit Template](https://replit.com/@AshishJob/Portfolio-Website-Template) is a useful source to tinker and experiment with.
- [HTML - HyperText Markup Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) is the programming language to structure pages.
- [CSS - Cascading Style Sheets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) is the programming language to style pages.
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is the programming language to work on the functions under the cover.

## Industry-Standard Tools (React.js, TypeScript, ESLint):

After a little while, I got bored with my project and wanted to switch to a project that I fully made on my own from scratch. I kept hearing about some industry-standard choices, and at the same time, I got placed into my University's ACM Organization's WebDev Committee that had a tech stack including, but not limited to, React.js, TypeScript, and ESLint, so that definitely helped the learning process. I still definitely had to reach out to some people to help me out on getting over the learning curve, but learning it definitely scales up your skills to make yourself more robust as a web developer. I read up on [React documentation](https://legacy.reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), some [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/), and [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/), and to roughly explain each: React.js is a JavaScript library built for making UI that pretty much combines HTML files and JS/TS files into one JSX/TSX file, and it is also component-based meaning that you can reuse components that you create instead of entirely recreating things that you may reuse; TypeScript is like a superset of JavaScript where you static typing is also introduced, making it a more versatile language; Finally, ESLint is a code analyzing tool that's essential functionality is to catch common programming errors, enforce style guidelines, and improve overall code quality.

### TLDR:
- [React.js](https://legacy.reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) is a JavaScript library to optimize web development.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) is a programming language built off of JavaScript, but improved to become more versatile.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/) is a code analyzing tool to help you write cleaner code.

## Advanced Tools and Frameworks:

Turns out I got bored of the industry-standard practices, and found out about Next.js, and it just looked really cool to me. I found out it was like React but with enhancements, pretty much like the JavaScript-TypeScript relationship and it's an actual framework instead of a library this time. For the other 2 parts, it was again another coolness factor that I personally took into account with their logos, but after using them, they just made life so much easier, that I started to have them as my crutch when it came to web development. With knowledge from the prior steps, these weren't hard to learn conceptually, but they just have a broader selection of available features, so really just researching what features are available and what you can experiment with is the best resource to get better accustomed to them. Here are their documentations: [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs), [TailwindCSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation), and for the component libraries, there are so many that it really comes down to personal preference and specific features that you may be looking to add into your website, but some popular ones include [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs), [Radix UI]([url](https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/overview/introduction)), [MUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/), [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com/), and many more. Finally to give an explanation on what each is: Next.js is a web development framework built on top of React that adds features like server-side rendering, static site generation, API routes, and file-based routing; TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that uses predefined classes directly in HTML to style components, speeding up development and ensuring consistent styling. Finally, Component libraries provide pre-built, customizable UI components that speed up development by offering ready-made solutions for common UI elements like buttons, forms, and modals.

### TLDR:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) is a web development framework built off of React that further accelerates development.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) is a CSS framework that merges CSS with HTML.
- Component Libraries are libraries of already made components, speeding up frontend development with standard and reusable components.
