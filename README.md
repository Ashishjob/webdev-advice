<div align="center"><h1>Web Dev Starter Guide / Advice:</h1></div>

<h3>Web Development is a really fun subfield to know about, but at the same time, it's an ever-growing subfield, so understanding the pipeline to learn it can be a bit confusing. Since it can get so confusing, I just wanted to share the path that I personally took to learn and understand it better.</h3>

## First Steps (Bare HTML/CSS/JS):

My personal first step into web development was a state of confusion for myself about where I should start and what I should build. After going down several rabbit holes that seemed too complex for me, I came across a portfolio site template on replit: [Portfolio Website Template](https://replit.com/@AshishJob/Portfolio-Website-Template) which was built on bare HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, of which I knew none. BUT I just messed around with different HTML tags and CSS definitions and looked into [HTML documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), and [JavaScript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) to understand what changes I could make. In case you aren't familiar with each technology, HTML is HyperText Markup Language which is a tool to mark the content and structure of pages, CSS is Cascading Style Sheets which is a tool to style each page with colors and features, and JavaScript is a programming language that works for the functions under the cover and very generally used in web development.

### TLDR:
- [Replit Template](https://replit.com/@AshishJob/Portfolio-Website-Template) is a useful source to tinker and experiment with.
- [HTML - HyperText Markup Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) is the programming language to structure pages.
- [CSS - Cascading Style Sheets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) is the programming language to style pages.
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is the programming language to work on the functions under the cover.

## Industry-Standard Tools (React.js, TypeScript, ESLint):

After a little while, I got bored with my project and wanted to switch to a project that I fully made on my own from scratch. I kept hearing about some industry-standard choices and thought to take a step forward and test the tools out. I definitely had to reach out to some people to help me out on getting over the learning curve, but learning it definitely scales up your skills to make yourself more robust as a web developer. I read up on [React documentation](https://legacy.reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), some [TypeScript documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/), and [ESLint documentation](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/), and to roughly explain each: React.js is a JavaScript library built for making UI that pretty much combines HTML files and JS/TS files into one JSX/TSX file, and it is also component-based meaning that you can reuse components that you create instead of entirely recreating things that you may reuse; TypeScript is like a superset of JavaScript where you static typing is also introduced, making it a more versatile language; Finally, ESLint is a code analyzing tool that's essential functionality is to catch common programming errors, enforce style guidelines, and improve overall code quality.

### TLDR:
